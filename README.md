# Pneumonia Detection

> _Image classification model to support the medical diagnosis of pneumonia based on chest X-ray image analysis_

The implementation uses a Convolutional Neural Network built with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and fine-tuned upon the pre-trained [ResNet18](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html#resnet18) model to work on the medical diagnosis of pneumonia disease support.

Additionally, there is a user interface prototype for possible real-world usage, which is built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
